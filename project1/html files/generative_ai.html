                <p>Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence algorithms that generate new content based on patterns learned from existing data. These models can produce text, images, music, and other forms of media, and are increasingly used in various applications such as creative writing, art generation, and data augmentation.</p>
                <p>One prominent example of generative AI is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two neural networksâ€”one generating new content and the other evaluating it. This adversarial process helps improve the quality of generated content. Another example is the use of large language models, like GPT-3, which can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.</p>
                <p>Generative AI has significant implications for industries ranging from entertainment to healthcare. It enables the creation of realistic synthetic data for training other AI models, assists in designing new products, and can even help in personalizing user experiences by generating content tailored to individual preferences.</p>
