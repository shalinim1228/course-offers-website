                <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve the efficiency and quality of software development and delivery. It aims to shorten the development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and deliver high-quality software more consistently.</p>
                <p>By fostering a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams, DevOps practices help organizations automate their processes, streamline workflows, and continuously integrate and deliver software. Key practices in DevOps include continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code.</p>
                <p>Implementing DevOps practices can lead to faster release cycles, improved product quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction. Organizations that embrace DevOps often experience more resilient systems and greater agility in responding to market demands.</p>
