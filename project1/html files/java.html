                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.</p>
                <p>Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), and large systems that need to be highly scalable and reliable. Its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy allows compiled Java code to run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
                <p>Java has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX, which makes it a versatile language for various types of applications, from web development to data analysis and beyond.</p>
