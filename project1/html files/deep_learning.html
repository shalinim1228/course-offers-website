                <p>Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze and learn from vast amounts of data. It is particularly effective in handling large-scale datasets and complex problems.</p>
                <p>Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn and extract features from raw data. These models are used in various applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
                <p>Recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant improvements in the performance of AI systems, making it a critical area of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
