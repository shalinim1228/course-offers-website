                <p>Full Stack Development refers to the development of both front-end and back-end portions of web applications. Full stack developers are skilled in working on all layers of an application, from the user interface (UI) to the server-side logic and database interactions. This makes them versatile and capable of handling various aspects of web development projects.</p>
                <p>The front-end development involves working with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual aspects of a website or web application. Back-end development focuses on server-side languages such as Node.js, Python, Ruby, or PHP, and databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. A full stack developer must be proficient in both areas to build complete, functional applications.</p>
                <p>Popular frameworks and libraries for full stack development include React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end, and Express.js, Django, and Laravel for back-end. Mastery of these tools and technologies enables developers to create dynamic and responsive applications that provide a seamless user experience.</p>
