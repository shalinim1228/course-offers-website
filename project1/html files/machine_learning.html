                <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. ML algorithms can identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>
                <p>There are various types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type has its own applications and techniques, ranging from classification and clustering to neural networks and deep learning.</p>
                <p>Machine learning is widely used across industries for tasks such as predictive analytics, image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. Its ability to analyze large volumes of data and improve over time makes it a powerful tool for innovation and problem-solving.</p>
