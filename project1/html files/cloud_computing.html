                <p>Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and manage computing resources over the internet. This model enables businesses and individuals to use computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, and software on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than owning and maintaining physical infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Key benefits of cloud computing include cost savings, scalability, and flexibility. By leveraging cloud services, organizations can quickly scale their IT resources up or down based on demand, reducing the need for significant capital investment in hardware and software. Additionally, cloud computing facilitates collaboration and remote work by providing access to resources from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
                <p>Cloud computing services are typically categorized into three main types: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each of these models provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management depending on the needs of the user.</p>
