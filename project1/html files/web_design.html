                <p>Web design and development involve creating and maintaining websites. Web designers focus on the visual aspects of a website, such as layout, color schemes, and typography. They use design tools and technologies like Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, or Figma to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
                <p>Web development, on the other hand, focuses on the technical side of building a website. It includes front-end development, which involves creating the visual components of a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development, which involves server-side programming using languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby.</p>
                <p>Both web design and development are crucial for creating successful websites that are both functional and attractive. A good web design ensures a positive user experience, while effective web development ensures that the website operates smoothly and efficiently.</p>
