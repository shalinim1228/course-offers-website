                <h3>About C Programming</h3>
                <p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, developing operating systems, and embedded software. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.</p>
                <p>One of the main strengths of C is its ability to provide low-level access to memory through pointers, which makes it highly efficient. C is also known for its portability across different hardware platforms.</p>
                <p>C is the foundation of many modern programming languages, and its syntax and concepts have influenced languages like C++, Java, and Python.</p>

                <h3>About C++ Programming</h3>
                <p>C++ is an extension of the C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s. It adds the concept of classes and objects, enabling object-oriented programming (OOP).</p>
                <p>C++ supports both high-level programming, with features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, and low-level memory manipulation, making it a versatile language for different types of applications.</p>
                <p>C++ is commonly used in software development, particularly in areas requiring high performance, such as game development, real-time simulations, and large-scale system software.</p>
